### 1.2 Application

All present and future owners, mortgagees, lessees and occupants of Lots and their employees, and any other persons who may use common elements of the Property in any manner are subject to the Declaration, these Bylaws and rules and regulations made pursuant hereto, and any amendment to these Bylaws or the Declaration upon the same being passed and recorded in the manner set forth in the respective Association Documents. The acceptance of a deed of conveyance or the entering into of a lease or the act of occupancy of a Lot shall constitute an agreement that these Bylaws (and any rules and regulations made pursuant hereto) and the provisions of the Declaration, as they may be amended from time to time, are accepted, ratified and will be complied with.

## ARTICLE II: Lot Owners

### 2.1 Name and Nature of Association

THE COLONY AT NODA ASSOCIATION, INC. (the “Association”) shall be a nonprofit corporation, organized under the laws of the State of North Carolina, and the membership shall be comprised of all of the Lot Owners as herein provided, which Association shall be governed by the Executive Board (the "Board”) as herein provided.

### 2.2 Place of Meetings

All meetings of the Association shall be held at the Property, or at such other place, within the State of North Carolina, as shall be designated in a notice of the meeting.

### 2.3 Annual Meeting

There shall be a regular annual meeting of the Lot Owners held each year during the same month of each succeeding year, for the purpose of electing members of the Board and for the transaction of such other business as may be properly brought before the meeting.

### 2.4 Substitute Annual Meetings

If the annual meeting shall not be held in the month designated by the Bylaws, a substitute annual meeting may be called in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5 of this Article. A meeting so called shall be designated and treated for all purposes as the annual meeting.

### 2.5 Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Lot Owners may be called at any time by the Board, the Chairman or upon the written request of twenty percent (20%) of the Lot Owners.

### 2.6 Notice of Meetings

Written or printed notice stating the place, day and hour of any meeting shall be delivered or mailed not less than ten (10) days nor more than fifty (50) days prior to the date thereof, either personally or by postage prepaid mail, at the direction of the Board, the Chairman or Lot Owners calling the meeting and to each person entitled to vote at such meeting who may request a representative to attend the meeting of Lot Owners.

Notice given to any one tenant-in-common, tenant by the entirety or other joint owner of a Lot shall be deemed valid notice to all joint owners of such Lot.

The notice of any meeting must state the time and place of the meeting and the items on the agenda, including the general nature of any proposed amendment to the Declaration or these Bylaws, and budget changes, and any proposal to remove Board members or officers.

When a meeting is adjourned for less than thirty (30) days in any one adjournment, it is not necessary to give any notice of the adjourned meeting, other than by announcement at the meeting at which the adjournment is effective.

### 2.7 Quorum

The presence in person or by proxy at any meeting of the Voting Members (as defined in Section 2.8 of this Article) having at least fifty percent (50%) of the total votes shall constitute a quorum. If there is no quorum at the opening of the meeting of Lot Owners, such meeting may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of a majority of the Voting Members present, either in person or by proxy; and at any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. 

The Voting Members at a meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough Voting Members to leave less than a quorum.

### 2.8 Voting Rights

There shall be one person with respect to each Lot ownership who shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of the Lot Owners (the "Voting Member"). The Voting Member may be the Owner, or one of a group composed of all of the Owners of a Lot, or may be some other person designated by such Owner(s) to act as proxy on his or their behalf, and who need not be an Owner. Each Lot Owner or group of Owners (including the Board, if the Board or its designee shall then hold title to one or more Lots) shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote for each Lot owned by such Owner.

### 2.9 Majority Vote

The vote of a majority of the votes represented at a meeting at which a quorum shall be present, in person or by proxy, shall be binding upon all Lot Owners for all purposes except where a higher percentage vote is required by the Declaration, these Bylaws or by law.

### 2.10 Proxies

The Voting Members may vote either in person or by agents duly authorized by written proxy executed by such Lot Owner or his duly authorized attorney-in-fact. A proxy shall be valid only for the particular meeting designated therein, unless the person executing it specifies therein the length of time for which it is to continue in force, which time shall not extend beyond eleven months from the date of its execution. Unless a proxy otherwise provides, any proxy-holder may appoint in writing a substitute to act in his place. In order to be effective, all proxies must be filed with the secretary or duly acting secretary of the Association, either during or prior to the meeting in question.

### 2.11 Waiver of Notice

Any Voting Member may, at any time, waive notice of any meeting of the Association in writing, and such waiver shall be deemed to be equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance by a Voting Member at any meeting of the Association shall constitute a waiver of notice by him of the time and place thereof, except where a Voting Member attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called. If all of the Voting Members are present at any meeting of the Lot Owners, no notice shall be required, and any business may be transacted at said meeting.

### 2.12 Informal Action by Lot Owners

Any action which may be taken at a meeting of the Association may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of the Voting Members and filed with the secretary of the Association to be kept in the Association's minute book.

## ARTICLE III: Executive Board

### 3.1 Number

The business and property of the Association shall be managed and directed by the Executive Board (the "Board”), composed of three (3) persons, or by such executive committees as the Board may establish pursuant to the Bylaws; provided, however, that the Board may not act on behalf of the Association to amend the Declaration, to terminate the Association, to exercise the Association's right of first refusal under the Declaration, to elect members of the Executive Board, or to determine the qualifications, powers, duties or terms of office of Board members. The Board may, however, fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term.

### 3.2 Initial Members

The initial members of the Board (referred to as directors herein) shall be selected by the Declarant, and need not be Lot Owners. Such initial directors shall serve at the election of the Declarant from the date upon which the Declaration is recorded in the Mecklenburg County Public Registry, until such time as their successors are duly elected and qualified.

### 3.3 Election

Except as provided herein, the directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of the Association, and those persons who receive the highest number of votes shall be deemed to have been elected. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board shall consist of three (3) directors during the period that Declarant is entitled to appoint a majority of the directors. The Declarant shall have the right to appoint all of the directors until the earlier of the following three dates: (a) within 120 days after the date by which 75% of the Lots have been conveyed to Lot purchasers, or (b) the date upon which Declarant surrenders control of the Association to the Lot Owners, or (c) five (5) years from the date of the Declaration.

The Declarant can turn over control of the Association to such Lot Owners other than the Declarant prior to such dates in its sole discretion by causing all or part of its appointed directors to resign, whereupon it shall be the affirmative obligation of Lot Owners other than the Declarant to elect directors and assume control of the Association. Provided at least thirty (30) days' notice of Declarant's decision to cause its appointees to resign is given to Lot Owners, neither the Declarant, nor such appointees, shall be liable in any manner in connection with such resignations even if the Lot Owners other than the Declarant refuse or fail to assume control.

Within sixty (60) days after the Lot Owners other than the Declarant are entitled to elect such director or directors, or sooner if the Declarant has elected to accelerate such event as aforesaid, the Association shall call, and give not less than ten (10) days' nor more than fifty (50) days' notice of a meeting of the Lot Owners to elect such director or directors of the Board. The meeting may be called and the notice given by any Lot Owner if the Association fails to do so.

The size of the Board may be increased or decreased from time to time upon the affirmative vote of three-fourths (3/4) of all Lot Owners, provided that said Board shall not be less than three (3) in number.

### 3.4 Term and Qualification

Each director shall hold office for the term for which he was elected, or until his death, resignation, retirement, removal, disqualification or until his successor is elected and qualified. At the meeting of the Association in which the Lot Owners other than the Declarant are entitled to elect a majority of the directors, the directors of the Board shall remain at three (3) and divided into three (3) classes, the first class to consist of one (1) director, the second class to consist of one (1) director, and the third class to consist of one (1) director. The director of the first class shall initially hold office for a term of three years; the director of the second class shall initially hold office for a term of two years; and the director of the third class shall initially hold office for a term of one year. At all annual elections thereafter, a number of directors shall be elected by the Voting Members to succeed the director whose term then expires. Each such director shall serve for a three-year term. So long as Declarant shall own one or more Lots, the director of the Board which Declarant has the right to designate shall be a member(s) of the third class. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the election of a director to succeed himself. Each director, except those selected by the Declarant pursuant to the Bylaws, shall be one of the Lot Owners or co-owners, or a spouse of a Lot Owner or co-owner, provided, however, that in the event a Lot Owner is a corporation, partnership, trust or other legal entity other than a natural person or persons, then an officer or director of such corporation, partner of such partnership, beneficiary of such trust or manager of such other legal entity, shall be eligible to serve as a director.

### 3.5 Removal

Directors may be removed from office with or without cause by the affirmative vote of at least sixty-seven percent (67%) of the votes entitled to be cast by all Voting Members present and entitled to vote at any meeting of the Voting Members at which a quorum is present. If any directors are so removed, new Board members may be elected at the same meeting; provided, however, that the person(s) selected by Declarant cannot be removed without the prior written consent of Declarant.

### 3.6 Vacancies

A vacancy occurring in the Board may be filled by a majority of the remaining directors, though less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director; but a vacancy created by an increase in the authorized number of directors shall be filled only by election at an annual meeting or a special meeting of Lot Owners called for that purpose. The Voting Members may elect a director at any time to fill any vacancy not filled by the Board. 

In the event that Declarant, in accordance with the rights herein established, selects any person to serve on any Executive Board of the Association, Declarant shall have the absolute right at any time, in its sole discretion, to replace such person with another person to serve on any Board. Replacement of any person designated by Declarant to serve on the Board shall be made by written instrument delivered to any officer of the Association, which instrument shall specify the name of the person to be replaced and the name of the person designated as successor to the person so removed from the Board. The removal of any such Board member and the designation of his successor shall be effective immediately upon delivery of such written instrument by Declarant to any officer of the Association.

### 3.7 Compensation

The Board shall receive no compensation for their services unless expressly allowed by the Board at the direction of the Lot Owners other than the Declarant having two-thirds (2/3) of the total votes.

### 3.8 Executive Committees

The Board may, by resolution adopted by a majority of the number of directors fixed by these Bylaws, designate two or more of its members to constitute an executive committee, which committee, to the extent provided in such resolution, shall have and may exercise all of the authority of the Board in the management of the Association. 

The Board may, in like manner, create such other committees as it deems necessary and appropriate in aiding the Board to carry out its duties and responsibilities with respect to the management of the Association.

## ARTICLE VI: Operation of the Property

### 6.1 Assessment and Determination of Common Expenses

The Board shall from time to time, and at least annually, prepare a budget for the Association, for the purpose of determining the amount of the Assessments to be collected from the Lot Owners in order to provide for the Common Expenses of the Association, and allocate and assess such Common Expenses among the Lot Owners equally. The Common Expenses shall include, without limitation, the expenses, costs and charges incurred in connection with the administration, operation and management of the Association Property and the expenses, costs and charges incurred in connection with any and all agreement between the Association and The Colony at NODA Association, Inc.; the cost of maintenance, repair, replacement and restoration of the Common Elements, or any part thereof; the cost of water usage by the Association; the cost of all insurance premiums on all policies of insurance required to be or which have been obtained by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the Declaration; such amounts as the Board may deem proper for the convenience, comfort and well-being of the Lot Owners, and for the operation, management and maintenance of the Property, including, without limitation, an amount for working capital of the Association, for a general operating reserve, for a reserve fund for replacements, and to make up any deficit in the Common Expenses for any prior year; in proper cases, the cost of administration and of maintenance and repair of the Limited Common Elements; and any other expenses lawfully agreed upon.

In establishing a reserve fund for replacements, the Board shall take into account the number and nature of replaceable assets, the expected life of each asset, and the expected repair or replacement cost. The Board shall then set the required capital contribution in an amount sufficient to permit meeting the projected capital needs of the Association with respect to both amount and timing by equal annual installments over the applicable period.

Within thirty (30) days after adoption by the board of any proposed budget for the Association, the Board shall provide a summary of the budget to all Lot Owners and shall give notice of a date for a meeting of the Lot Owners to consider ratification of the budget not less than fourteen (14) nor more than thirty (30) days after mailing of the summary and notice. A quorum need not be present at the meeting. The budget is ratified unless at the meeting a majority of all the Lot Owners present and entitled to cast a vote reject the budget. In the event the proposed budget is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified shall be continued until such time as the Lot Owners ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the Board.

### 6.2 Payment of Assessments

All Lot Owners shall be obligated to pay (1) General Assessments for Common Expenses assessed by the Board from. time to time, and at least quarterly; (2) special assessments to be established and collected as provided herein, and (3) specific assessments against any Lot which are established pursuant to the terms of these Bylaws. A late payment charge in an amount to be determined by the Board shall be assessed for any assessment installment not paid within fifteen (15) days of its due date. Any installment not paid within fifteen (15) days of its due date shall be subject to the late payment charge and shall accrue interest as provided in Section 6.5, and shall constitute a lien on the Lot as provided in Section 6.6 of this Article VI.

No Lot Owner shall be liable for the payment of any part of the Common Expenses assessed against his Lot subsequent to a sale, transfer or other conveyance by him (made in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration and applicable restrictions of record) of such Lot. A purchaser of a Lot shall be jointly and severally liable with the seller for the payment of Assessments assessed against such Lot prior to the acquisition by the purchaser of such Lot; provided, however the lien assessed against such Lot shall remain in full force and effect. Any such purchaser shall be entitled to a statement from the Board setting forth the amount of the unpaid Assessments against the seller, and the Lot conveyed shall not be subject to a lien for any unpaid assessments in excess of the amount shown on the statement. Provided, however, that a First Mortgagee or other purchaser of a Lot at a foreclosure sale of such Lot or a First Mortgagee who takes a deed in lieu of foreclosure shall not be liable for, and such Lot shall not be subject to, a lien for the payment of Common Expenses assessed prior to the foreclosure sale or deed in lieu of foreclosure. Such unpaid Common Expenses shall be deemed to be Common Expenses collectible from all of the Lot Owners, including such purchaser, his successors and assigns.

### 6.3 Special Assessments

The Association may levy Special Assessments for Common Expenses not covered by the General Assessment, applicable to that year only for the purpose of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction, reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement upon the Common Elements, including fixtures and personal property related thereto, provided that any such Assessment must be approved by the vote of Owners of Lots to which at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes in the Association are allocated cast in person or proxy at a meeting duly called for this purpose. Such Special Assessments shall be charged to the Lots equally. In addition, the Board may levy Special Assessments against one or more, but less than all, of the- Lots to cover repairs or maintenance for which such Lot Owner or Owners are responsible and which they have failed to make, or for repairs or maintenance required of a Lot Owner or Lot Owners which impair the value of the Common Elements or the Lot or Lots, or expenses which are incurred in the abatement of or as a result of a violation by a Lot Owner or Owners of the provisions of the Declaration, the Bylaws or the rules, regulations, or for fines levied for said violations, or where the Board has purchased a Lot on behalf of one or more Lot Owners. The period of assessment and manner of payment of such assessment shall be determined by the Board.

### 6.4 Collection of Assessments

The Board shall determine Common Expenses against the Lot Owners from time to time, at least quarterly, and may, as the Board shall determine, take prompt action to collect any Assessments due from any Lot Owner which remain unpaid for more than fifteen (15) days from their due date. 

The Board shall notify First Mortgagees pursuant to the provisions of the Declaration for which any amount assessed pursuant to these Bylaws remains unpaid for more than sixty (60) days from their due date, and in any other case where the Lot Owner of such Lot is in default with respect to the performance of any obligation hereunder for a period in excess of sixty (60) days.

### 6.5 Default in Payment of Assessment

In the event of default by any Lot Owner in paying to the Board any amounts assessed by the Board, such Lot Owner shall be obligated to pay a late payment charge as established by the Board from time to time, and interest at the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum on such amounts from their due date; together with all expenses, including attorneys' fees (if permitted by law), incurred by the Board in collecting such unpaid sums. If a Lot Owner shall be in default in payment of an installment of an Assessment, the Board may accelerate the remaining installments upon ten (10) days' written notice to such Lot Owner, whereupon the entire unpaid balance of such Assessment shall become due upon the date stated in such notice.

### 6.6 Lien and Personal Obligation

Each Assessment provided for in this Article, together with late payment charges, interest and expenses, including attorneys' fees (as permitted by law), shall be a charge on and a continuing lien upon the Lot against which the Assessment is made when a notice of such lien has been filed of record in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, provided such notice of lien shall not be recorded until such sums assessed remain unpaid for a period of fifteen (15) days after the same shall become due. Said notice of lien shall also secure all Assessments against the Lot becoming due thereafter until the lien has been satisfied. Said lien may be foreclosed in the manner as a deed of trust on real property. In addition, each Lot Owner shall be personally liable for any Assessment against his Lot becoming due and payable while he is the Owner of such Lot.

### 6.7 Priority Of Assessment Lien

The lien of the Assessments provided for in this Article shall be prior and superior to all other liens except (a) ad valorem taxes, and (b) all sums unpaid on deeds of trust, mortgages or other encumbrances against the Lot prior to the docketing of the Assessment lien. The sale or transfer of any Lot shall not affect the Assessment lien against such Lot. Provided, however, the sale of a Lot pursuant to the foreclosure sale or execution sale instituted by a superior lien holder or conveyance to a First Mortgagee by deed in lieu of foreclosure shall extinguish the inferior Assessment lien against the subject Lot but no such sale or transfer shall relieve each Lot from liability for any Assessments thereafter becoming due or for any future lien in connection therewith. The Association shall share in the excess, if any, realized by the sale of any Lot pursuant to a foreclosure or action instituted by a superior lien holder, to the extent of its lien.

### 6.8 Owner's Non-Use

No Lot Owner may exempt himself from liability for Assessments and his other obligations to the Association by waiver of the use or enjoyment of any portion of the Common Elements or by the abandonment or sale of his Lot.

### 6.9 Foreclosure of Liens for Unpaid Assessments

Following the institution of any action by the Board to foreclose on a Lot because of unpaid Assessments, the Lot Owner shall pay a reasonable rental for the use of his Lot, and the plaintiff in such foreclosure action shall be entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the rental. The Board, acting on behalf of the Association, or on behalf of any one or more individual Lot Owners, if so instructed, shall have the power to purchase such Lot at the foreclosure sale and to acquire, hold, lease, mortgage, vote the votes appurtenant to, convey or otherwise deal with the same, subject, however, to applicable restrictions of record. A suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid Assessments shall be maintainable without foreclosing or waiver of the Assessment lien. Where a First Mortgagee or the purchaser of a Lot obtains title to the Lot as a result of foreclosure of the First Mortgage, such purchaser, its successors and assigns, shall not be liable for the share of the Common Expenses or Assessments by the Board chargeable to such Lot which became due prior to the acquisition of title to such Lot by such purchaser. Such unpaid share of Common Expenses or Assessments shall be deemed to be a Common Expense collectible from all Lot Owners, including such purchaser, its successors and assigns.

### 6.10 Statement of Common Expenses

The Board shall promptly provide any Lot Owner so requesting the same in writing with a written statement of all unpaid charges due from such Lot Owner, for which it may institute a reasonable charge at its discretion.

### 6.11 Abatement and Enjoinment of Violations by Lot Owners

The violation of any rule or regulation adopted by the Board or the breach of any bylaw contained herein, or the breach of any provision of the Declaration, shall give the Board the right, in addition to any other rights set forth in these Bylaws: (a) to make any repairs, and to summarily abate and remove, at the expense of the defaulting Lot Owner, any structure, thing or condition which may exist therein contrary to the intent and meaning of the provisions hereof, and the Board shall not thereby be deemed guilty in any manner of trespass; or, (b) to enjoin, abate, or remedy by appropriate legal proceedings, either at law or in equity, the continuance of any such breach at the expense of the defaulting Lot Owner; (c) in any case of flagrant or repeated violation by a Lot Owner, to require such Lot Owner to give sufficient sureties for his future compliance with such Association documents; or (d) after notice and an opportunity to be heard, to levy reasonable assessments and fines for such violations. The failure of the Board to-so act with respect to any such violation or breach shall not be deemed a waiver of the Board's right to act with respect to the same or any other breach or violation.

### 6.12 Duty to Report

Each Lot Owner shall promptly report to the Board or its agent any defect or need for repairs or replacement the responsibility for which is that of the Association.

### 6.13 Additions, Alterations or Improvements by the Association

Whenever in the judgment of the Board the Common Elements shall require additions, alterations or improvements, the Board shall proceed with such additions, alterations or improvements, and shall assess all Lot Owners for the costs thereof, as a Common Expense, subject, however, to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of this Article VI.

### 6.14 Use of Common Elements

A Lot Owner shall not interfere with the use of the Common Elements by the remaining Lot Owners and their guests and invitees.

### 6.15 Rules of Conduct

Rules and regulations concerning the use of the Lots and the Common Elements may be promulgated and amended by the Board. Such rules and regulations shall be equally applicable to all Lot Owners similarly situated and shall be uniform in their application and effect. Copies of such rules and regulations shall be furnished by the Board to each Lot Owner prior to their effective date.

### 6.16 Remedies Cumulative

All rights, remedies and privileges granted to the Association or the Owner or Owners of a Lot pursuant to any terms, provisions, covenants or condition of the Declaration or other above-mentioned documents, shall be cumulative, and the exercise of any one or more shall not constitute an election of remedies, nor shall it preclude the party thus exercising the same from exercising such other and additional rights, remedies or privileges as may be available to such party at law or in equity.

### 6.17 Nonwaiver of Remedies

1. The failure of the Association or any Lot Owner to enforce any right, provision, covenant or condition which may be granted by the Declaration or the other above-mentioned documents shall not constitute a waiver of the right of the Association or the Lot Owner to enforce such right, provision, covenant or condition in the future.
2. The failure of Declarant to enforce any right, privilege, covenant or condition which may be granted to it by the Declaration or other above-mentioned documents shall not constitute a waiver of the right of Declarant to thereafter enforce such right, provision, covenant or condition in the future.
3. The failure of a First Mortgagee to enforce any right, provision, privilege, covenant or condition which may be granted to it or them by the Declaration or other above-mentioned documents, shall not constitute a waiver of the right of said party or parties to thereafter enforce such right, privilege, covenant or condition in the future.

Such accounts shall include the following, or such other and further accounts as the Board from time to time shall determine:

1. General Common Expense Account--to which shall be credited collection of that portion of the Common Expense Assessments received for defraying the costs of operating the Association on a day-to-day basis, including normal maintenance and repairs, insurance and related charges;
2. Capital Reserve Account--to which shall be credited, all sums collected which are to be allocated for capital expenditures for the reconstruction, repair and replacement of Common Elements at a future date.

All sums collected by the Association, either as Assessments of the Common Expenses or Special Assessments, during any fiscal year and allocated to the General Common Expense Account or to any other account from which non-capital expenditures may be made, in excess of expenditures during such fiscal year made from or chargeable to said account or accounts shall be deemed contributions to capital at the end of said fiscal year, and shall be transferred to the Capital Reserve Account.
