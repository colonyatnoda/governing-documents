Such Special Assessments shall be chared to the Units according to their Allocated Interests in the Common Elements. In addition, the Board may levy Special Assessments against one or more, but less than all, of the Units to cover repairs or maintenance for which such Unit Owner or Unit Owners are responsible and which they have failed to make, or for repairs or maintenance required of a Unit Owner or Unit Owners which impair the value of the Common Elements or the Unit or Units, or expenses which are incurred in the abatement of or as a result of a violation by a Unit Owner or Owners of the provision sof the Declaration, the Bylaws or the Rules and Regulations, or for fines levied for said violations, or where the Board has purchased a Unit on behalf of one or more Unit Owners. The period of assessment and manner of payment of such assessment shall be determined by the Board.

### 6.4 Collection of Assessments

The Board shall determine Common Expenses against the Unit Owners from time to time, at least annually, and may, as the Board shall determine, take prompt action to collect any Assessments due from any Unit Owner which remain unpaid for more than 30 days from their due date.

The Board shall notify Eligible Mortgage Holders pursuant to the provisions of the Declaration fo any amount assessed pursuant to these Bylaws which remains unpaid for more than 60 days from its due date, and in any other case where the Unit Owner of such Unit is in default with respect to the performance of any obligation hereunder for a period in excess of 60 days.

In the event of default by any Unit Owner in paying to the Board any amounts assessed by the Board, such Unit Owner shall be obligated to pay a late payment charge as established by the Board from time to time, and interest at the rate of eighteen percent(18%) per annum on such amounts from their due date; together with all expenses, including attorneys' fees (as permitted by law), incurred by the Board in collecting such unpaid sums. If a Unit Owner shall be in default in payment of an installment of an Assessment, including but not limited to, the monthly installment based on the annual budget, the Board may accelerate the remaining installments upon ten days' written notice to such Unit Owner, whereupon the entire unpaid balance of such Assessment shall become due upon the date stated in such notice.

The Board may appoint an Adjudicatory Panel composed of five(5) Unit Owners, which may include members of the Board. The Adjudicatory Panel shall have the authority to levy fines not to exceed One hundred and Fifty ($150.00) per violation for a violation of the Declaration, these Bylaws, or any Rules and Regulations enacted by the Board. Prior to the imposition of any such fine, the Adjudicatory Panel shall send the defaulting Unit Owner written notice of the proposed fine and notice of the date, time and location for a hearing before the Adjudicatory Panel at which time the defaulting Unit Owner and the panel may present evidence. The notice of hearing shall be delivered personally or sent by certified mail before the hearing date. The Adjudicatory Panel shall provide the defaulting Unit Owner written notice of its decision once it is reached. The fine shall be an assessment secured by a lien under Section 47C-3-116 of the Act.

### 6.6 Lien and Personal Obligation

Each Assessment provided for in this Article, together with late payment charges, interest and expenses, including attorneys' fees (as permitted by law), shall be a charge on and a continuing lien upon the Unit against which the Assessment is made when a notice of such lien has been filed of record in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, in the manner provided by Article 8, Chapter 44, of the North Carolina General Statutes, provided such notice of lien shall not be recorded until such sums assessed remain unpaid for a period  of 30 days after the same shall become due. Said notice of lien shall also secure all Assessments against the  Unit becoming due thereafter until the lien has been satisfied. Said lien may be foreclosed in the manner as a deed of trust on real property. In addition, each Unit Owner shall be personally liable for any Assessment against his Unit becoming due and payable while he is the Owner of such Unit.

### 6.7 Priority of Assessment Lien

The lien of the Assessments provided for in this Article shall be prior and superior to all other liens except (a) ad valorem taxes and (b) all sums unpaid on deeds of trust, mortgages or other encumbrances against the Unit prior to the docketing of the Assessment lien. The sale or transfer of any Unit shall not affect the Assessment lien against cuh instituted by a superior lien holder or conveyance to Mortgagees by deed in lieu of foreclosure shall extinguish the inferior Assessment lien against the subject Unit but no such sale or transfer shall relieve each Unit from liability for any Assessments thereafter becoming due or for any future lien in connection therewith. The Association shall share in the excess if any, realized by the sale of any Unit pursuant to a foreclosure or action instituted by a superior lien holder, to the extent of its lien.

A suit to recover a money judgement for unpaid Assessments shall be maintainable without foreclosure or waiver of the Assessment lien. Where an institutional lender or the purchaser of a Unit obtains title to the Unit as a result of foreclosure of a mortgage, such purchaser, its successors and assigns, shall not be liable for the share of the Common Expenses or Assessments by the Board chargeable to such Unit which became due prior to the acquisition of title to such Unit by such purchaser. Such unpaid share of Common Expenses or Assessments shall be deemed to be a Common Expense collectible from all Unit Owners, including such purchaser, its successors and assigns.
