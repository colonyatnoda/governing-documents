When more than one person owns an interest (other than a leasehold or a security interest) in any Lot, all such persons shall be Members and the voting rights appurtenant to said Lot shall be exercised as they, among themselves, determine, but in no event shall more than one (1) vote be cast with respect to any one (1) Lot not owned by the Declarant.

2. five years from the date of this Declaration, or
3. written notice of consent to such conversion by the Declarant.

The Declarant rights as Class B Member are not intended to apply to voting within the Lofts Condominium Association or the Shops Condominium Association, but only to voting rights within the Association.

2. Owners of Lofts Condominium Units shall pay Level A2 Dues; and
3. Owners of Shops Condominium Units shall pay Level A3 Dues.

##### Basic Dues

Basic Dues shall be the pro-rata share of all expenses incurred related to the maintenance of the Common Area, any portions of the Property that are shared by all Owners and maintenance related to the Shops Condominium Association. Basic Dues shall include the administrative costs of maintaining and operating the Association. Basic Dues shall be determined by dividing the total of such expenses by the total number of Lots on the Property (except as to the Lofts Condominium Units, which shall be based on the square footage of each Loft Condominium Unit, as set forth in more detail in the Lofts Condominium Declaration and the Owners of Shops Condominium Units shall cumulatively pay 2.70% of the total of the Basic Dues, which 2.70% shall be prorated among the Owners of the Shops Condominium Units.) This provision of the Declaration cannot by modified or terminated without the written consent of the Declarant.

##### Level A1 Dues

Level A1 Dues shall be Basic Dues and the pro-rata share of all expenses related to the Single Family Townhome Lots. For purposes of determining such pro-rata share, the Level A1 Dues shall be determined by dividing the total of such expenses related by the total number of Single Family Townhome Lots on the Property.

##### Level A2 Dues

Level A2 Dues shall be Basic Dues and the pro-rata share of all expenses related to the Lofts Condominium Association, as set forth in the Lofts Condominium Declaration. For the purposes of determining such pro-rata share, the Level A2 Dues shall be determined  by dividing the total square footage in each Condominium Unit by the total square footage of all Residential Condominium Units, as set forth in the Lofts Condominium Declaration. Level A2 Dues may be further subdivided  to provide for payment of Common Elements and Limited Common Elements (as defined in the Lofts Condominium Declaration) as appropriate under the Lofts Condominium Declaration. Until the Lofts Condominium Declaration has been recorded in the Mecklenburg County Public Registry, Level A2 Dues shall be the same amount as the Level A1 Dues for each Building Pad shown on a recorded plat.

##### Level A3 Dues

Level A3 Dues shall be the pro-rata share of 2.70% of the Basic Dues rate and the pro-rata share of expenses related to the Shops Condominium Association, as set forth in the Shops Condominium Declaration not provided for herein. For purposes of determining such pro-rata share, the Level A3 Dues shall be determined by dividing the total square footage in each Retail Condominium Unit by the total square footage of all Retail Condominium Units, as set forth in the Shops Condominium Declaration. Level A3 Dues may be further subdivided to provide for payment of Common Elements and Limited Common Elements (as defined in the Shops Condominium Declaration) as appropriate under the Shops Condominium Declaration. Until the Shops Condominium Declaration has been recorded in the Mecklenburg County Public Registry, Level A3 Dues shall be the same amount as the Level A1 Dues for each Building Pad shown on a recorded plat.

##### Special Note Concerning Payment of Dues by Owners of Condominium Units

Payment by Owners of Lofts Condominium Units and the Shops Condominium Units of the appropriate dues to the Lofts Condominium Association and the Shops Condominium Association respectively may satisfy said Owners obligations to pay dues under this Declaration if the Shops Condominium Association and Lofts Condominium Association set the dues structure to include both sets of dues.

##### Class B Membership Dues

The Class B Member shall not pay dues for each Lot owned by it but shall have the right to pay any shortfall between the actual Association expenses and the actual revenues raised from the other Members. The Class B Member shall at all times have the right to satisfy its obligations hereunder by providing services in-kind for the Association, such services to have a value mutually agreed upon by the Association and the Declarant.

## ARTICLE V: COVENANT FOR MAINTENANCE ASSESSMENTS

### Section 5.1 Creation of the Lien and Personal Obligation of Assessments

The Declarant, for each Lot within the Property, hereby covenants and each Owner of any Lot by acceptance of a deed therefor, whether or not it shall be so expressed in such deed, is deemed to covenant and agree to pay to the Association: (1) Annual Assessments or charges (2) General Special Assessments for capital improvements and (3) Specific Special Assessments, as determined by the Association, such assessments to be established and collected as hereinafter provided. Any such assessment or charge, together with interest, costs, fines and reasonable attorney's fees shall be a charge on the land and shall be a continuing lien upon the property against which each such assessment or charge is made. Each such assessment, together with interest, costs, fines and reasonable attorney's fees shall also be the personal obligation of the person who was the Owner of such property at the time when the assessment or charge fell due.

### Section 5.2 Purpose of Assessments

1. The Assessments levied by the Association shall be used to promote the recreation, health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Property and in particular for the maintenance and improvement of the Common Area.
2. The Assessments levied by the Association may also be used to provide insurance for the Common Area, the parking facility of the Shops Condominium, and the Townhome Buildings.
3. The Assessments shall also be used to pay the cost of maintaining the parking facility and other expenses related to the Shops Condominium. Such payment shall be considered part of the costs of maintaining the Common Area.
4. The Assessments shall also be used for maintenance and service to the Single Family Townhome Lots including, but not limited to, landscaping, exterior maintenance of the dwellings, front porches, rails and roofs of the Single Family Townhome Lots.
5. All monies collected by the Association shall be treated as the separate property of the Association, and such monies may be applied by the Association to the payment of any expense of operating and managing the Property, or to the proper undertaking of all acts and duties imposed upon it by virtue of this Declaration, the Articles of Incorporation and the Bylaws of the Association. As monies for any assessment are paid to the Association by any Owner, the same may be commingled with monies paid to the Association by the other Owners. Although all funds and common surplus, including other assets of the Association, and any increments thereto or profits derived therefrom, shall be held for the benefit of the Members of the Association, no Member of the Association shall have the right to assign, hypothecate, pledge or in any manner transfer his membership interest therein, except as an appurtenance to his Lot, by whatever means, and the Association shall not be required to account to such Owner for any share of the fund or assets of the Association, or which may have been paid to the Association by such Owner, as all monies which any Owner has paid to the Association shall be and constitute an asset of the Association which may be used in the operation and management of the Property.
6. The foregoing notwithstanding, no Assessment of any kind may be used for the purpose of filing or pursuing of any legal action of any sort whatsoever (including but not limited to lawsuits, arbitrations, administrative proceedings, and mediations) unless 1) such use is approved by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of all votes entitled to be cast by all Owners (including the Declarant) and 2) the approval of the Declarant for so long as the Declarant owns any Lot (unless such action is against the Declarant, in which case this subsection shall not apply.) Such limitation shall not apply, however, and Assessments may be used, for the bringing of any action to collect dues or to enforce the use restrictions set forth in this Declaration, or for the defense of any action brought against the Association.

### Section 5.3 Maximum Annual Assessment

1. Until January 1 of the year immediately following the year in which conveyance of the first Lot to an Owner is made, the Annual Assessment for Level A1 Dues shall be $1,223.80 per year;
2. The Level A2 Dues are set forth in more detail in the Lofts Condominium Declaration. Until the Lofts Condominium is formed by the recording of the Lofts Condominium Declaration and amendments thereto, the Level A2 Dues shall be the same amount as Level A1 dues for each Lot that does not qualify as a Single Family Townhome Lot.
3. The Level A3 Dues are set forth in more detail in the Shops Condominium Declaration. Until the Shops Condominium is formed by the recording of the Shops Condominium Declaration and amendments thereto, the Level A3 Dues shall be the same amount as Level A1 Dues for each Lot that does not qualify as a Single Family Townhome Lot.
4. The Annual Assessments shall be established by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The Annual Assessments may be increased by the Board of Directors, without approval by the membership, by a percentage not to exceed the sum of ten percent (10 %) per year. Any annual increase in excess of ten percent (10 %) shall require approval by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of each class of Members who are voting in person or by proxy, at a meeting duly called for this purpose. The foregoing notwithstanding, no approval shall be required for any increase of the dues which are directly attributable to insurance premiums on Units and/or Buildings.
5. The Board shall have the right to reduce the Annual Assessments at any time.

### Section 5.4 Capital Contribution

Every Owner other than the Declarant shall likewise be responsible for an initial capital contribution in the amount of one month of dues. Such capital contribution shall be due upon transfer of the title to any portion of the Property to the Owner from Declarant or another Owner, and shall be maintained and applied for operating/working capital expenses.

### Section 5.5 Notice And Quorum For Any Action Authorized Under Sections 5.3

Written notice of any meeting called for the purpose of taking any action authorized under Section 5.3 hereof shall be sent to all Members not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than sixty (60) days in advance of the meeting. At the first such meeting called, the presence of members or of proxies entitled to cast sixty percent (60%) of all the votes of each class of membership shall constitute a quorum. If the required quorum is not present, another meeting may be called subject to the same notice requirement, and the required quorum at the subsequent meeting shall be one-half (1/2) of the required quorum at the preceding meeting. No such subsequent meeting shall be held more than sixty (60) days following the preceding meeting.

### Section 5.6 Rate Of Annual Assessment

Both Annual and General Special Assessments must be fixed at a uniform rate for all Lots within each subclass and shall be collected on a not more often than a monthly basis.

### Section 5.7 Date Of Commencement Of Annual Assessments Due Date

The Annual Assessments provided for herein shall be due in full on January 1 of each calendar year (other than the first year in which such Assessments are levied, in which case, such are due immediately upon assessment), and shall be payable, as determined by the Association in its absolute discretion, on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis on the first business day of each calendar month, quarter or year. The first such annual assessment shall be adjusted according to the number of days remaining in the calendar year after conveyance of the first Lot to an Owner.

General and Specific Special Assessments shall be due immediately when levied by the Association, or at such other time determined by the Association. The Special Assessments may be levied by the Association in an amount up to $200.00 annually without the approval of the Membership.

At least thirty (30) days in advance of each annual assessment period, the Board of Directors shall fix the amount of the annual assessment against each Lot for the next year and at least thirty (30) days before January 1 shall send written notice of such fixed assessment to every Owner subject thereto. The Association shall, upon demand, and for a fee to be determined by the Association, furnish a certificate signed by an officer of the Association setting forth whether the assessment on a specified Lot has been paid.

Failure by any Owner to pay any dues in a timely fashion shall give the Association the right to accelerate all dues for the year in which such deficiency occurs. Upon notice of such acceleration, the delinquent Owner shall immediately be obligated to pay all remaining dues for that year.

### Section 5.8 Effect Of Nonpayment Of Assessments: Remedies Of The Association

Any Assessment not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date shall bear interest from the due date at the highest rate allowed by law. In addition to such interest charge, the delinquent Owner shall also pay such late charges or fines as may have been theretofore established by the Board of Directors. The Association may bring an action at law against the Owner personally obligated to pay the same or foreclose the lien created herein against the property in the same manner as prescribed by the laws of the State of North Carolina for the foreclosure of deeds of trust, and interest, late payment fees, costs and reasonable attorney's fees for representation of the Association in such action or foreclosure shall be added to the amount of such assessment. No Owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for the assessments provided for herein by abandonment of his Lot; nor shall damage to or destruction of any improvement on any Lot by fire or other casualty result in abatement or diminution of the assessments provided for herein.

Provided, however, that an Owner's failure to pay any assessment shall not constitute a default under any mortgage given by that Owner, unless expressly agreed to by the Owner in writing.

### Section 5.9 Exempt Property

The assessments, charges and liens created under this Article V shall not apply to any Lot the title to which is vested either in any first mortgagee subsequent to foreclosure or in the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or the Administrator of Veterans Affairs or any other state or federal governmental agency which acquires title by reason of such agency's guarantee or insurance of a foreclosed mortgage loan; provided, however, that upon the resale of such property by such first mortgagee or such governmental agency the assessment herein provided shall again commence and accrue and shall be fully applicable to such Lot upon the conveyance to any subsequent Owner. All land which shall be dedicated to and accepted by a local public authority, and all land granted to or used by a utility company, and property owned by a nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under the laws of the State of North Carolina shall be exempt from the assessments and charges created herein.

### Section 5.10 Subordination to the Lien of First Mortgages

The lien of the assessments provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first priority deed of trust or first mortgage. The sale or transfer of any Lot shall not affect the assessment lien; provided, however, the sale or transfer of any Lot which is subject to any first deed of trust or first mortgage, pursuant to a foreclosure thereof or under a power of sale, or any proceeding in lieu of foreclosure thereof, shall extinguish the lien of such assessment as to payments which became due prior to such sale or transfer.

### Section 5.11 Application of Payments

In the event an Owner pays any funds after the imposition of any fines, or the incurrence of collection fees, the funds paid shall be applied first to any fines levied, then to any other late fees, if any, then to any special assessment, if any, then to the Annual Assessments, if any.

## ARTICLE VI: ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL

No improvement of any sort shall be commenced, erected, or maintained upon the Property or any Lot, nor shall any exterior addition to or change or alteration made to any Dwelling, Building or Unit (including but not limited to, color or painting or the exterior and type of exterior finish) without the express approval of the Declarant, so long as the Declarant owns any Lot, and thereafter, by the Board of Directors of the Association. In the event an Owner desires to erect an improvement, or alter the exterior of any Dwelling, Building or Unit, the Owner shall submit to the Declarant (or the Board, as appropriate), two copies of the plans and specifications showing the nature, kind, shape, height, materials, and location of the improvements. The Declarant shall have absolute discretion as to the approval or denial of any improvements. The Board of Directors shall base its approval or denial upon reasonable consideration as to harmony of external design and location in relation to surrounding structures and topography. Absent such approval, the proposed improvement may not be commenced.

In the event an Owner of any Lot shall make unauthorized changes to any Dwelling, Building or Unit and the improvements situated thereon in a manner unsatisfactory to the Declarant (or the Board of Directors) the Declarant (or the Board of Directors) shall have the right, through its agents and employees, to enter upon said Lot, or into said Dwelling, Building or Unit, and to repair, maintain and restore the Lot, or the exterior of the Dwelling, Building or Unit so that the improvement and/or violation no longer exists. The cost of such action, including materials and labor, and any other costs or attorney's fees incurred in the enforcement of the rights under these provisions shall be considered a Specific Special Assessment against that Owner(s) and said Lot(s).

Construction of new structures or improvements only shall be permitted, it being the intent of this section to prohibit the moving of any existing structure or improvement onto any Lot Dwelling, Building or Unit.

2. **Condominium Units:** Each Owner of a Condominium Lot shall be responsible for the maintenance obligations not assumed by the Lofts Condominium Association or the Shops Condominium Association, as set forth in more detail in the respective Condominium Declarations.
3. **Association:** Should an Owner fail to discharge his maintenance, repair or replacement responsibilities in a reasonable and prudent manner to standards harmonious with that of other Lots in the Subdivision, as determined by the Declarant in its discretion or, after the Declarant owns no portion of the Property, by the Association, then the Declarant (or Association, if appropriate) in its discretion may demand that the Owner promptly comply with the same by mailing a notice thereof to the Owner at his address, specified in his contract to purchase such Lot and by posting such notice on the Lot. If the Owner has not complied therewith within five (5) days thereafter, the Association shall have the right to cause such maintenance, repair or replacement to be performed and to charge the cost thereof as a part of and in addition to the regular assessment attributable to the Lot and provided for in this Declaration, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein. Should an Owner fail to pay any charge billed in accordance with this subparagraph (d) within fifteen (15) days of such billing, then the Association shall have the right to levy fines and to claim a lien against the Lot and to foreclose such lien, all as provided for in this Declaration. No such entry as provided herein shall be deemed a trespass.

After the completion of construction of a Townhome Unit and the conveyance of that Townhome Unit by Declarant to an ultimate purchaser, if all or any portion of a Townhome Unit is damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, it shall be the duty of the Association, with all due diligence, to repair or reconstruct such Unit using the same design plans as used in the original construction of the Townhome Unit. If such plans are not reasonably available, the Association shall rebuild the Unit in substantially the same style, configuration, and interior and exterior appearance as it existed immediately prior to the casualty. Reconstruction shall be undertaken within thirty (30) days after receipt of the insurance funds, and shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the damage occurs, unless prevented by causes beyond the control of the Association.

### Section 7.3 General Maintenance Provisions

1. In the event that the need for maintenance, repair or replacement is caused through the willful or negligent act of the Owner, his family, guests or invitees, the cost of such maintenance, repair or replacement shall be added to and become a part of the assessment to which such Lot is subject, notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained herein.

However, the foregoing shall not be construed to prohibit temporary deposits of trash, rubbish and other such debris for pick up by trash removal service units, but such deposits shall only be permitted upon the specific day of pick up. In the event any Owner fails or refuses to keep his Lot free from unsightly objects, weeds, or underbrush or to maintain the structures of each Dwelling in a manner satisfactory to the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors may, five days after delivering notice to the Owner requesting the Owner comply with the requirements of this paragraph, enter and remove all such unsightly objects or vegetation at Owner's expense and Owner agrees to pay such costs incurred by the Association in the enforcement of this paragraph, such charge being deemed a Specific Special Assessment.

On Buildings that have a southern-facing front elevation, or that for whatever reason cannot reasonably use satellite dishes subject to the foregoing limitations, it shall be permissible to place one satellite dish, not attached to the Unit, in the front or side yard of such Lot, provided that such dish is no more than three feet from the Unit, and is screened from view by landscaping, such installation to be specifically approved by the Association. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Association shall permit television signal reception antennas pursuant to FCC regulations published at 47 C.F.R. § 1.4000 subject to certain conditions as approved by the Association.

No Townhome Lot shall be subdivided by sale or otherwise, except by and with the written consent of Declarant and in compliance with local ordinances. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Declarant shall at all times have the right to reconfigure all unsold Townhome Lots, provided that such reconfiguration is in compliance with local ordinances. Such reconfiguration by the Declarant need not result in the same number of Lots existing in the Subdivision, it being the intent of this Section to provide the Declarant with the right to change the size, number, and use (i.e.: from Townhome to Condominium; from Condominium to Townhome) of any unsold Lots in the Subdivision.

### Section 8.16 Fire

The purpose of these easements shall be to provide, maintain, and operate drainage facilities and utility service lines to, over or for each of the Townhome Lots. Within these easements, no structure, planting or other material shall be placed which may interfere with the installation or maintenance of utilities, or which may change the direction or flow of drainage channels in the easements. The easement area and all improvements in it shall be maintained by Owner, except for those improvements for which a public authority or utility company is responsible. With ten (10) days prior written notice to Owner, Declarant may exercise the right to remove obstructions in such easements upon Owner's failure to do so, at Owner's expense, and Owner agrees to pay costs incurred by Declarant in doing so. For the purpose of this covenant, Declarant reserves the right to modify or extinguish the easements herein along any Lot lines in its sole discretion. For the duration of these restrictions, no such utilities shall be permitted to occupy or otherwise encroach upon any of the easement areas reserved without first obtaining the prior written consent of Declarant; provided, however, local service from utilities within easement areas to residences constructed upon any such Lots may be established without first obtaining separate consents therefor from Declarant.

### Section 8.24 Garages

No garage, carport or similar structure shall be constructed anywhere on any Townhome Lot other than by Declarant or as approved by the Association.

### Section 8.25 Enforcement
